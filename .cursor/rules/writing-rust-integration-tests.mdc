## Testing conventions

- When adding new tests or modifying old ones, always run them to check the correctness of the changes being made.
- Always attempt to find related tests in an existing test file before creating a new test file
- Run the tests strictly in the crate where they are located and avoid running all the tests in the workspace.
- Be rigorous and test for edge-cases and unexpected inputs.

## Test Organization

- Integration tests for API operations must always be written in the tests folder located in the root folder of the crate.
- One integration test file should represent only one API operation.
- The name of an integration test file representing a single API operation should follow the format `{crate_name}__{api_operation_name}.rs`.
