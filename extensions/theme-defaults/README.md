### Recommendations for theme tokens naming:

- don't add `-color` postfix. Css variables are exclusevly used for colors anyway
- write full attribute name (ex: `background` not `bg`)
- instead of `-text` of `-icon-color` postfix use `-foreground`. It means a color on top of the background, it can be used for both icon color and text color of the component
