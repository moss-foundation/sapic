/// Use `Location` to route UI messages to a specific surface within the
/// application shell. Variants are ordered from most global to most
/// ephemeral.
///
/// - `Window`: Application-wide surface (e.g., status area).
/// - `Notification`: Persistent, actionable message in the notifications UI.
/// - `Toast`: Short-lived, non-blocking overlay near the edge of the window.
///
/// # Semantics
/// * `Window` is suitable for low-noise, ambient progress (spinners, brief text).
/// * `Notification` is used for items that may require user attention or actions.
/// * `Toast` is for ephemeral hints that disappear automatically.
